# CPSLimiterHQ ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/hlv6JDZ.png)

This plugin is inspired by the Anti-Macro/Autoclicker made for the ElevateMC.com server.

# General Info
With this plugin, you can limit the number of CPS (Clicks Per Second) allowed on the server. If a player exceeds the specified amount set by the server, they will receive a 5-second penalty during which no hits will be registered against their opponent.

# Config
This plugin allows you to configure the CPS limit (default: 15 CPS), as well as change the delay or penalty duration (default: 5 seconds).

You can use */cpshq reload* to reload the edited plugin configuration from the "config.yml" file.
